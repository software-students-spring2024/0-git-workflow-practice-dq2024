# Link
Here is a [link](https://medium.com/gitconnected/the-5-paid-subscriptions-i-actually-use-in-2024-as-a-software-engineer-edd9949df58b) to an article I find interesting.

# Why Do I Find This Article Interesting
This article is interesting to me because it gives a succinct overview of five tools that can be beneficial to Software Engineers. Personally, I believe it is always important to familiarize oneself with tools that are being used by Software Egingineers in the industry. Even if you do not end up using the tool it is still helpful to know what is going on. For example, the article talks about a search engine called Kagi. Personally, I will never switch from Chrome as I am the most comfortable navigating throughout it, but I thought it was interesting to see why the author prefers Kagi over Chrome. I also learned about Excalidraw and ended up playing around with it. It was super easy to use and I actually prefer it to designing diagrams over something like Figma.

I think this is interesting article because I think that the tools would be useful to me as well. I think that GitHub Copilot has saved me an insane amount of time. Kagi seems like something I would definately do this.
